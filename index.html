            <p>Hello! My name is Eric Hogan and I am orginally from Montana in the United States however I have lived in Idaho for the past several years. During the warmer months I really enjoy playing disc golf and going into the mountains with my wife. When the warmer months begin to fade I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy books as well as playing video games.</p>
